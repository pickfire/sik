Slide Image Kiosk
=================

Preview images with gallery and slide show with websockets.

Simply image kiosk written in python3 with Sanic framework.

Allows uploading and real time slide show, no offline mode.

No external dependencies, only 3KB uncompressed/unminified.

Why python? Time + ??? Maybe in another language next time.
